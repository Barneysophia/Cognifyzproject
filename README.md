### Project Overview

The focus of this project is to understand the investment behaviors and preferences of participants through data analysis. By examining the dataset, the main aim is to reveal insights into gender distribution, key numerical metrics, popular investment avenues, the reasons behind investment choices, savings goals, sources of investment information, investment durations, and the expectations participants have from their investments.

### Dataset:
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Data_set2-Copy.csv" file, contains individuals investment preferences and behaviors.

## Task 1
### Data Overview
### Objective: To understand the dataset structure
In Task 1, I loaded the dataset into a data analysis tool Tableau and used descriptive statistics to gather information on the dataset's structure, including the number of entries, columns, and data types. This helped establish a foundational understanding of the dataset's characteristics and organization.

## Task 2
### Gender Distribution
### Objective: To visualize gender distribution in the dataset
In Task 2, I focused on visualizing the gender distribution. First, I extracted the gender information from the dataset and then created a visualization, such as a bar chart or pie chart, to illustrate how genders are distributed among the dataset entries. This visualization provides a clear overview of the gender demographics represented in the data.

## Task 3
### Descriptive Statistics
### Objective: To present basic statistics for numerical columns 
In Task 3, I first identified columns containing numerical data, such as age or income, and then utilized statistical functions to compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for each numerical column. This process provided key numerical insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
