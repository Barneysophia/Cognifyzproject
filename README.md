### Project Overview

The focus of this project is to understand the investment behaviors and preferences of participants through data analysis. By examining the dataset, the main aim is to reveal insights into gender distribution, key numerical metrics, popular investment avenues, the reasons behind investment choices, savings goals, sources of investment information, investment durations, and the expectations participants have from their investments.

### Dataset:
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Data_set2-Copy.csv" file, contains individuals investment preferences and behaviors.

## Task 1
### Data Overview
### Objective: To understand the dataset structure
In Task 1, I loaded the dataset into a data analysis tool Tableau and used descriptive statistics to gather information on the dataset's structure, including the number of entries, columns, and data types. This helped establish a foundational understanding of the dataset's characteristics and organization.

## Task 2
### Gender Distribution
### Objective: To visualize gender distribution in the dataset
In Task 2, I focused on visualizing the gender distribution. First, I extracted the gender information from the dataset and then created a visualization, such as a bar chart or pie chart, to illustrate how genders are distributed among the dataset entries. This visualization provides a clear overview of the gender demographics represented in the data.

## Task 3
### Descriptive Statistics
### Objective: To present basic statistics for numerical columns 
In Task 3, I first identified columns containing numerical data, such as age or income, and then utilized statistical functions to compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for each numerical column. This process provided key numerical insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

## Task 4 
### Most Preferred Investment Avenue
### Objective: To identify the most preferred investment avenue
In Task 4, I examined the column that contains information about various investment avenues, such as equity or mutual funds, and determined which investment avenue had the highest frequency or occurrence among the dataset entries. This analysis provided insights into the preferred investment choices of the participants represented in the data.

## Task 5 
### Reasons for Investment
### Objective: Analyze and summarize reasons for investment choices

In Task 5, I examined the dataset column where these reasons were documented, identified common themes or recurring motivations among participants, and then compiled a summary highlighting the key reasons influencing their investment decisions. This analysis aimed to uncover the underlying factors driving investment preferences within the dataset.

## Task 7
### Common Information Sources
### Objective: To analyze common sources participants rely on for investment information

In Task 7, I explored the dataset column where participants indicated their sources of investment information, then identified and summarized the most frequently cited sources among participants. This analysis aimed to uncover the channels through which investors gather information to inform their investment decisions.

## Task 8
### Investment Duration
### Objective: To calculate the average investment duration

In Task 8, I analyzed the dataset column that contains information about participants' investment durations and applied statistical methods such as mean, standard deviation calculation to determine the average duration of investments made by the participants. I updated the average duration column using SQL to reflect more accurate data. This analysis provided insights into typical investment holding periods.
